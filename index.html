        <h1>THE MODERN MARVEL THAT IS PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to my web page. I hope you have a wonderful experience here as I take you through photography.So, let us get into it. I am going to try and show you what it entails and the wonderful impact it has had on the world today from my own point of view, as well as that of other people.</p>

        <h2>What is Photography?</h2>
        <span>
            <div>
                <p> According to Wikipedia, photography is the <strong>"art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as a photographic film"</strong>. 
                    Sounds pretty technical huh? But if you ask me, I'll tell you that photgraphy is the ability to capture history, emotions, concepts, beauty and so much more in a single image. It is a way of touching, feeling and loving. What's captured on film is captured forever. Just think how wonderful that is!</p>
                <p>Photography is said to have beem around since the <em>5th Century B.C.E. </em>Try reading up on it to see how it has come to be since then. <a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/brief-history-of-photography-2688527" target="_blank">Learn more.</a></p>
