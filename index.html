      as I take you through photography.So, let us get into it. I am going to
      try and show you what it entails and the wonderful impact it has had on

        <p>
          According to Wikipedia, photography is the
          <strong
            >"art, application and practice of creating durable images by
            recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor
            or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as a
            photographic film"</strong
          >. Sounds pretty technical huh? But if you ask me, I'll tell you that
          photgraphy is the ability to capture history, emotions, concepts,
          beauty and so much more in a single image. It is a way of touching,
          feeling and loving. What's captured on film is captured forever. Just
          think how wonderful that is!
        </p>

          Photography is said to have beem around since the
          <em>5th Century B.C.E. </em>Try reading up on it to see how it has
          come to be since then.
